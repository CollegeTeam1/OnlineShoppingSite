Using SQL server,we created a database for users(customers,vendors,delivery personnel and admins).
Then we created a website to do and run the functionalities we needed

There are many supported funcionalities such as:
- sign up and login
- adding to cart or wishlist
- placing orders
- adding a credit card
- choosing payment method
- choosing delivery method
- the admin confirming a new employee
- the vendors posting products
- a recommendation system based on similar users and previous purchases
